# Mouse Tracker Project

## Overview

The Mouse Tracker Project is a Qt/QML application designed to offer an intuitive interface for tracking mouse movements. This project demonstrates the fundamental capabilities of Qt and QML in creating a tool that visualizes and records mouse position in real-time. It provides a clear and interactive way to monitor mouse activity, making it an ideal example for understanding basic input handling and user interface design with Qt/QML.

## Usage

1. **Launch the Application**: Use the build instructions in the Repository README.md to compile and run the application.
2. **Track Mouse Movements**: Move the mouse around the application window to see real-time tracking data.
