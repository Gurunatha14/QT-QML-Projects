# Signal Light Project

## Overview

The Signal Light Project is a Qt/QML application designed to simulate a traffic signal light system. This project showcases the use of Qt and QML to create an interactive and visually engaging traffic light interface. The application cycles through the standard traffic light colors—red and green—demonstrating the fundamental capabilities of Qt/QML in creating simple yet effective simulations and user interfaces.

## Usage

1. **Launch the Application**: Follow the build instructions in the Repository README.md to compile and run the application.
2. **Observe the Signal Light**: Watch as the traffic light cycles through red and green phases.
3. **Interact (if applicable)**: Use any provided controls to manually switch between signal states or adjust the timing.
