# Model-Based HMI Project

## Overview

The Model-Based HMI Project is an interactive Qt/QML application designed to display critical vehicle metrics through a series of dynamic gauges. This project highlights the capabilities of Qt and QML in creating a user-friendly interface for monitoring vehicle performance. The application features a speedometer, fuel indicator, and RPM gauge, providing a clear and real-time visualization of key parameters. It serves as an excellent example for understanding basic HMI design and implementation using Qt/QML.

## Usage

1. **Launch the Application**: Follow the build instructions provided in the Repository README.md to compile and run the application.
2. **View Gauges**: The main interface will display the speedometer, fuel indicator, and RPM gauge.
3. **Monitor Parameters**: Observe real-time updates on each gauge to track vehicle speed, fuel level, and engine RPM.
4. **Customize and Manage**: Use the available options and features to customize and manage gauge displays as needed.
