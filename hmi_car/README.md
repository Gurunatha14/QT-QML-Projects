# Car HMI Project

## Overview

The Car HMI Project is a Qt/QML application designed to provide a comprehensive interface for vehicle management. This project integrates a Google Map interface and a car dashboard to offer a real-time overview of vehicle location and essential metrics. Using Qt and QML, the application showcases advanced features like GPS navigation and vehicle status monitoring, making it an excellent example of modern HMI (Human-Machine Interface) design.

## Usage

1. **Launch the Application**: Follow the build instructions in the Repository README.md to compile and run the application.
2. **Interact with the Google Map**: View the real-time vehicle location and navigate using the integrated Google Map.
3. **Monitor the Dashboard**: Access and observe key vehicle metrics through the dashboard, including speed, fuel level, and RPM.
