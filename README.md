# Qt QML Projects

## Overview

Welcome to the Qt QML Projects repository! This repository contains a collection of projects developed using Qt and QML. These projects demonstrate various use cases of the Qt framework and QML language, showcasing different aspects of cross-platform application development with modern UI design.

## About

Qt is a powerful cross-platform application framework that allows you to create applications with graphical user interfaces (GUIs). QML is a declarative language for designing user interface-centric applications and is part of the Qt framework. This repository contains a variety of sample projects demonstrating different aspects of Qt and QML.

## Projects

This repository contains multiple projects, each organized into its own directory. Each project directory includes its own `README.md` file with detailed information on that specific project.

*Each project directory contains instructions, features, and usage details relevant to that specific project.*

## Getting Started

To get started with any project in this repository, follow these general steps:

### Prerequisites

- **Qt**: Download and install the latest version of Qt from the [official Qt website](https://www.qt.io/download).
- **Qt Creator**: Recommended for an easier development experience.
- **CMake**: Ensure CMake is installed for building the projects.

## Features

- **Diverse Examples**: Various projects covering different use cases of Qt and QML.
- **Modular Structure**: Each project is contained in its own directory with specific instructions.
- **UI Design**: Examples of designing intuitive and modern user interfaces using QML.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: QML
- **Backend**: Depending on the project, may include C++ or other supported languages
- **Build Tools**: CMake or Qt Creator

### Setting Up the Projects

Follow these general instructions to set up and run each project:

#### For Projects Using CMake

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Gurunatha14/QT-QML-Projects.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd qt-qml-projects/ProjectName
    ```

3. Create a build directory and navigate to it:

    ```bash
